 # Country Code From Timezone


This repo holds the script to fetch the updated timezone details from IANA database and creates a json holding timezones list and country codes. Inappropriate for production applications due to the presence of identical time zones associated with different country codes.

# How to Run
Clone the repo and just run. Works only on Mac and Linux.

```sh

bash fetch_timezones.sh

```
